X$ Asset XML Bulk Modifier:
============

Description:
============
Collection of useful functions to parse and modify X4 game asset files.  I principally use it to support the generation and upkeep of my personal engine and shield mods, though it is trivially generalizable to arbitrary bulk asset file modification.  If executed directly it will generate a series of diagnostic and diff files to alter all extant engines and shields available in the game with parameters that present various transformations of both base game and VRO balance parameters.

Several filesystem assumptions are hardcoded into the main portion of the script rather than meaningfully externalized and should be adjusted to suit your environment.
